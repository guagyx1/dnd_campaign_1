### Reigarde and The Empire

The Setting of our first campaign is known generally as the [[Arborea\|Arborea]], in the country of [[Reigarde\|Reigarde]]. 

The land of Reigarde is vast and varied, with multitudinous geographies and biomes, littered with towns, villages, coasts and ports. With a population numbering in the millions, most of the people and places in Reigarde fall under the political, economic, cultural, and social control of the [[The Empire\|The Empire]], known colloquially as just the Empire. 

The Empire is vastly powerful governing and controlling force in Reigarde, often acting as the ultimate top-level authority over the towns and villages under their influence. The Empire is also heavily beaurocratic, with it's power structures branching down into layers of hierarchy and power spreading out over all of Reigarde, and although there is little resources and attention devoted to areas in the fringes of the empire's dominion, there is almost always *some* imperial presence in places of notable population, with positions of power almost always filled with powerful Wizards of the empire, with more powerful wizards the higher up the hierarchy you go. While the empire is not necessarily Malevolent, it is quite imperialistic, militaristic, and pragmatic, particularly pertaining to the wars with the factions of the neighbouring countries it is participating in. 

As a faction with the upper-brass almost entirely composed of Wizards and Mages, the Empire is host to some of the most powerful, and mass produced mortal [[Campaign/Magic/Magic\|magic]] in Arborea. 

### Magic

The many manifestations of fantastical phenomena in the world of Arborea do not seemingly stem from a single source. The land of Arborea is abound with a variety of spellcasters and magical artifacts and lands. The most common types of spell casters are [[Wizards\|Wizards]], most of which finding their place in the hierarchy of [[The Empire\|The Empire]], though are not exclusive to it. Wizards have learned to cast spells through rote study and practice. In general, Wizard spellcasting is performed through the structured use of symbolic runes, materials, and verbal components. One of the most common material components in wizard spellcasting is the use of magic ink, which is required for the drawing of these runes on surfaces (usually paper). The study and development of these runes across Arborea is likened to the study and creation of a language, and different cultures or groups of wizards have often developed their own style when it comes to how they create their spells. The most affluent of these "languages" of magic is that used by the Wizards of The Empire, and has been branded the [[Imperial Arcana\|Imperial Arcana]].  (Lemme know if you wanna play a wizard).

Other types of spellcasters exist as well, such as Sorcerers and Warlocks, however they are generally more commonly found outside of [[Reigarde\|Reigarde]], and often make up the militant spellcasting force of nations and factions antagonistic to the empire. (We can develop these more if you wanna play one).

Another notable type of spellcaster, though they don't call themselves such like Wizards do, is [[Witches\|Witches]]. Witches are powerful spellcasters that do not exert power through grand gestures or runic language, but rather through extraordinary willfulness, and everyday rituals, in harmony with the people, nature, and magic that surrounds them. (Think shrine maidens, or like sagely Witches at the edge of a remote village or forest who provide aide, blessings, or advice.) Witches are infamous for their curses, but they are generally reserved for those who have wronged the Witch, or the people and places under their care, rather than placed on a whim. Witches are also known to make small gifts, handcrafts, or home goods that are capable of small bits of magic.

One of the most significant factors of Witches that make them so powerful in Arborea, is due to their harmonic tenderness and care when it comes to nature and magic. Witches are often seen by others to be the peacemakers, mediators, and communicators between the mortals of Arborea, and the [[Campaign/Campaign Info/Knowledge/Spirits\|Spirits]] that are a large part of the world. Powerful witches often take it upon themselves to speak on bahalf of humans to spirits, and vice versa to preserve balance between the world of spirits, and the mortal realm.  As such, Witches are particularly versed in the magic of [[Promises and Treaties\|Promises and Treaties]].  (Lemme know if you wanna play as one of these)
### Spirits

While humanoids know the physical world to be named "Arborea", that's not quite the whole story. Beyond the [[liminal space\|liminal space]] found at the boundaries* of Arborea, is [[The Spirit World\|The Spirit World]], extending both beyond and parallel to the mortal realm. Folklore and belief within Arborea has the Spirit world as much more ancient than the mortal realm, with some of it's inhabitants having played a role in the genesis of the mortal world, though the veracity of such statements have never been confirmed. 

The Spirit world is habitat to Many great and small spirit alike, most of which are host to some sort of spiritual magic and power, that may manifest itself both in the spirit and mortal realms. 
Some great spirits are so vast and powerful, as to reflect cosmic forces, landscapes, and phenomena, and some may end up being worshipped as gods by a village or township. 

Because Spirits are largely composed of spiritual energy and generally are bound to the spirit realm, they are susceptible to the magic of [[Promises and Treaties\|Promises and Treaties]]. Sometimes less powerful spirits can be bound or trapped in the mortal realm, and find it difficult to return. Large spirits however can choose to manifest themselves in places where they are more powerful, such as sites of their worship, in order to act upon the physical realm. Spirits are not necessarily benevolent or malevolent, but are known to strike deal with mortals, most commonly Witches. 

A Promise made between a Spirit and a Witch is immensely powerful. For example, if a Witch promises a great spirit offerings in exchange for safety and protection over a village, even the most powerful of spirits will not be able to will themselves to bring harm against said village. 

(Lemme know if you wanna place as one of these?).
