## Disclaimer: 
This is just a narrative bit I'm writing in to sort of explain how the amnesia might have felt to discover for your character, and how it worked. So a couple assumptions were made about how you felt, but it's up to you how these things really affected your character. If you would like for your discovery of your amnesia to have happened differently, or earlier, or later, for your character because the vibe isn't what you were going for, let me know, I'm fully intending on roleplaying how this scene played out in a flashback during a session! This is a pretty edgy/broody take.  I'll have another bit discreetly explaining the mechanics of the amnesia at the end. 

# ------------



**It didn't happen suddenly.** 

For several years you've made your own way, surviving by yourself, or maybe with the odd partner on a particular job, or riding with a few travelers townwards in silence, but you've never had a chance to divulge to anyone. You never had a reason to, you've always been cagey with your past, you never thought it to be important. *You never thought about it much at all.*

**Until somebody bothered to ask you.** 

It was a couple years back at this point. You don't quite remember the specifics. All the little details of the encounter have been whittled away over time as if by a knife, through your repeated recalling. But what is left, clear as day, the *burning nugget* that haunts your *every* waking moment. The question she asked you. 

**"So where are you from?"**

The easiest, most ubiquitous question in the world. An obligatory ice breaker, or borne out of genuine curiosity? It doesn't matter. Before that day, You never even had the thought to answer one of these questions before, it was a waste of time and thought, that you could've spent on furthering your own survival. 

She, like everyone else, of course, didn't receive your answer. But this time, things were a little different. A feeling of dread, hate, melancholy... emptiness, whatever you want to call it. Just like every time before, an iota of this feeling rose up in the depths of your heart as you dismissed the query. 

But this time, you bothered to notice it. To *question* it. 

For the first time, as far as you can remember, you interrogated your own feelings. Interrogated yourself, about why you never bothered to answer. The cool and mysterious vibe must have suited you. Your past isn't that important anyway, you've been doing this for as long as you can remember. 

**the feeling grows.** 

I mean, how would it benefit you, or anyone else for that matter, to know about your past? What you used to be like, where you're from? Let's see, most recently, you've-

**--BACKSTORY STUFF I DON'T WANT TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ON--**

And before that, you were **--YOU CAN DECIDE WHAT THE FIRST THING YOU REMEMBER WERE, AND YOUR BACKSTORY FROM THERE--** ...

That must have been six or seven years ago now, and before that...

### ***The feeling is all consuming.*** 

before that... 

That's when it hits you all at once. The feeling, the realization, the awareness, the question. Where are you from? You tried to recall. You tried to gleam anything from beyond these recent years. 

Where are you from? Who are your parents? What did you do? What languages did you used to speak? What food did you used to like? Who taught you in school? Who were your friends? What were you like as a child? 

**Who are you? Who *were* you?**

Like a sleek yet viscous oil. These questions stick to you, yet in trying to answer them, they slip between your fingers onto the ground, impossible to grasp. You're lost. 

Years later, you try to make due with what you have. You have a new life now, starting from six to seven years ago, maybe you can make the most of it. But when you look around you, you can't help but notice the fullness of other people. The bright thing they carry with them that they cannot see. Where your peers carry entire worlds, entire histories with them, you harbour nothing but an unsettling void. Let's hope you can fill it with something.


Phew so much edge!

# Amnesia

So basically the way the amnesia works, as  far as your character is concerned, is that they actually have a fine memory, as any other normal person, but are unable to recall anything from over about 7 years ago (we can adjust the timeline if needed if you want to have a certain amount of stuff in your backstory be post-amnesia). Any development skills like language, walking, etc, is totally fine, you still know that stuff, but specific people, events, the name of your parents, etc, are totally lost to you.

Any personal traits you might have had, like your attitude, disposition, personality, or a trait like hating croissants, may have come from either before or after amnesia (up to you!), but any inciting incidents as to why you are that way, if they happened pre-amnesia, are lost to you. 

You suspect that something weird may have happened to you, but you've never been able to confirm. You have had interactions with other amnesiacs, but due to the nature of memory loss, you haven't been able to discern if they've been afflicted with the exact same thing as you. 

The entire period of time of post-amnesia to present day, is up to you to decide in your backstory! How did the amnesia get realized by your character? How do they react to it? how do they handle it emotionally? Are they committed to finding out what happened to them? How did they attempt to start a new life post-amnesia?
