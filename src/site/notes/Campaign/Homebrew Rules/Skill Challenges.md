Skill challenges often reflect difficult or complicated objectives that typically require rolls, input, and action from multiple members of the party. 

When an objective is given as a skill challenge, the players must take turns based on initiative order (or of their choosing if the matter is not immediately time-sensitive), taking actions or completing tasks to further the goal of the objective. The players will be the ones coming up with what actions to take, and perhaps arguing for which ability or skill check should reflect it. The player will then roll against a DC (difficulty class) decided by the DM to see if the attempted action reflects a success or a failure. 

Skill challenges will keep tally of a certain number of successes or failures on the part of the party, and will have a variable outcome depending on how well the players do. 


## Example: 

The party wants to find information about the leader of the thieves' guild, who is particularly slippery. The DM has decided that a success to accomplish this objective reflects 5 successes, while a failure represents 3 failures. 

The party will roll initiative to decide turn order, though there is no combat. 

The first player decides to try to look for them directly. However, as this is just not really that good of an idea, the DM decides the DC for trying to accomplish this is a 25 investigation check, or a nearly impossible task. The player fails the check, adding a failure tally. 

Players 2, 3, 4, go next in order, looping back around to player one when everyone goes, on and on. 

By the end, the party has succeeded on 4 rolls, and failed on 2, meaning the next skill check decides the success or failure of the plan. 

the last player succeeds, meaning the objective is completed successfully, but not flawlessly. The party does indeed gain a lead on where the leader of the thieves' guild is hiding, but because they also failed twice, they've telegraphed their investigation, and the thieves' guild may be aware of the party. 

Had the last player failed, the objective would have been a failure, and the party would not have gained any substantial leads, and may have also given away their intentions as well. Although some information may have still been gained from the successes.
