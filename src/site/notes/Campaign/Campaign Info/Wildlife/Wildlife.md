a plant that traps people but instead of eatting them, just tried to suffocate or hold them into the dirt for compost. 

a plant that implants seeds into the skin of creatures to sprout later and reproduce. scary!

general names like "man-eatting plant" are just a common name that may describe actually a wide variety of monsters, just like how entymology works in real life. 

i mean basically any monster in dungeon meshi. 

Golems as a garden- harvest the stuff on them! if you dare. 

something that disguises as a flower to catch insects.
