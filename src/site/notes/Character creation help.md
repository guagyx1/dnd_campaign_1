Need help making a character? here are some things to think about! 

# Gameplay

What kind of character do you want to play Gameplay wise? I can help you with a recommended class and stat spread if you answer these questions for me

Do you want a combat oriented class, or a roleplay oriented class?

Do you want to play a Martial class (weapons), a Caster(spells), or a mix?

Do you want to be in the front or backlines?

of the six attributed, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom, Intelligence, Charisma, which two do you want to excel in, and which one do you want to be weak in?
# Roleplay

Now these are the important questions to think about when writing your backstory and character. 
If you can answer all or most of these questions confidently, you got a pretty fleshed out guy, and you can more easily write from there! One sentence, or even a couple words is usually enough for these questions! Remember these are just brainstorming questions, so you don't *actually* have to write down answers for them. 

Remember, feel free to talk to me and collaborate with me on character stuff, it always makes the process easier and more fun to play when it comes to the game. If you had an idea for an event, hometown, relationship, side character, or shared history with other players, LET ME KNOW, WE CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN BABY
# Characterization

**What's a gimmick that your character has that's easy to roleplay and identify?** ex. jokester, quick to anger, know-it-all, naive, prissy noble, habitual liar, brooding loner, etc. 
This one is important, it is a shallow yet highly recognizable aspect of who your character is, and is the first thing people will latch onto, and it will help you get into character as well! It's also a good starting point in terms of thinking about what kind of vibe you want your character to have!

**What kind of first impression do you want your character to make on someone they just met?**

**What kind of impression do you want your character to make on someone who knows them well?**

**You meet someone for the first time, what's the first thing you notice about them?**

# Conflict

**Main conflict: The main conflict your character faces. This sets the groundwork for your character arc, as it gives you a direction to grow in. Of course, that direction may not be where they end up, but it informs your motivations at the start. This conflict should be deeply personal, and it can heavily inform the backstory you want to start with, as well as facilitate how you want your character to change throughout the story.**

ex. Persecuted for a crime you didn't commit, being chased by authorities, Lost a loved one, suffering a great injustice. Object of a prophecy, discovering a mystery, disowned by your powerful family, looking for a long-lost friend/family member. 

**What other minor conflicts are you dealing with? These can be something like an internal conflict, two aspects of yourself you can't seem to square, or an external conflict, such as a debt owed to a powerful noble, a relationship you're trying to keep afloat, or an internal code you're struggling to follow.**

**What's the worst case scenario for these conflicts? The best case scenarios? 

**What kind of toll do these conflicts have on the character?** 

**How long do you want these conflicts to last?**

**How do you want your character to grow in response to these conflicts?**
# Goals/wants

**Now that we have the conflicts and problems your character is facing down, we need to decide what it is they actually want. Your main want is the deepest desire you have at the beginning of the story. Having something you actually want to accomplish is ABSOLUTELY KEY to writing a character that is motivated and has agency, rather than just a passive observer. 

ex. I want to find out who my parents are, I want to save the kingdom from the impending disaster, I want to be accepted by my peers, I want those who have wronged me to suffer, I want to rule my father's kingdom well. 

**A want can set up a character arc that you may go on, but that want may end up being replaced by a different want, or even a need, as the character changes and comes to grips with that it is they really need as is informed by how the story pans out (so don't worry about future needs now).**** 

ex. I want to change so that my parents accept me as their heir -> through a character arc -> I need to love myself as I am. 

**What will happen to your character after they get what they want? What if they never get what they want?**

**How far are they willing to go to achieve their goals? Is there anything else that's more important?**

## Disclaimer:

It's important to remember that these conflicts and goals might never be resolved, and they are thought about mainly to inform your character, backstory, choices, behaviour, and motivations, they're not just like the "main quest" of the campaign.
