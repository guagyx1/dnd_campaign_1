Need help making a character? here are some things to think about! 

# Gameplay

What kind of character do you want to play Gameplay wise? I can help you with a recommended class and stat spread if you answer these questions for me

Do you want a combat oriented class, or a roleplay oriented class?

Do you want to play a Martial class (weapons), a Caster(spells), or a mix?

Do you want to be in the front or backlines?

of the six attributed, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom, Intelligence, Charisma, which two do you want to excel in, and which one do you want to be weak in?
# Roleplay

Now these are the important questions to think about when writing your backstory and character. 
If you can answer all of these questions confidently, you got a pretty fleshed out guy! 

Remember, feel free to talk to me and collaborate with me on character stuff, it always makes the process easier and more fun to play when it comes to the game. If you had an idea for an event, hometown, relationship, side character, or shared history with other players, LET ME KNOW, WE CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN BABY

What is a lie that your character believes?

What kind of flavours do they like?
